        <p>
          I am an aspiring full stack developer currently pursuing a Bachelor's
          in Software Engineering. I have completed the IBM Full Stack
          JavaScript Developer professional certificate on Coursera, which
          equipped me with skills in both frontend and backend technologies.
          While I haven't worked professionally in a full stack role yet, I have
          built several practice projects on my own to apply and enhance my
          learning. I'm passionate about building modern web applications and
          continuously improving my development skills.
